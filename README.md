# Bank fraud dectection
The [Bank Fraud (BAF) dataset suite](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022), introduced at NeurIPS 2022, comprises 6 synthetic datasets for bank fraud detection. It's designed to be a comprehensive, realistic test bed with over 32 attributes. Our goal is to leverage this data to visualize trends and develop a machine learning model to predict bank fraud transactions.

## Motivation
We wanted to select a dataset with enough relevant detail to allow
us to work on this project. After selecting a dataset that turned out
to be a sample and given the feedback we received, we wanted to
be more careful in our choice of dataset. We chose this dataset
because it is straightforward , contains enough data and attributes,
and is reliable.
