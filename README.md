# bank-fraud-detection
The Bank Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, introduced at NeurIPS 2022, comprises 6 synthetic datasets for bank fraud detection. It's designed to be a comprehensive, realistic test bed with over 32 attributes. Our goal is to leverage this data to visualize trends and develop a machine learning model to predict bank fraud transactions.
